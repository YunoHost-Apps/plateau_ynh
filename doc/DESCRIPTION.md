Plateau helps designers organize and document participatory workshops. With Plateau one can: 

(1) Plan a workshop structure and prepare the resources they will need. 
(2) Run workshops accordingly, documenting what happens through notes, photos, video or audio recording, as the workshops unfold. 
(3) Revisit the materials captured, enrich them, archive them or publish them.
